                        <p><strong>Aligned SDG:</strong> Goal 8.3 - <em>Promoting development-oriented policies to support productive activities, decent work creation, and innovation.</em></p>
                        <div class="abstract"> 
                        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>Upon using a power tool onsite, there are significant issues and delays upon handling the device as it is possible to obtain the Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS) upon long exposures of utilizing such devices. There are other risks that are exposed to the user like the weight distribution which harms the relationship between the user and device. Additionally, most power tools focus on having a unimodal function. With this, the product, as a multifunctional handheld battery-operated concrete vibrator, seeks to address the conundrum. Below the eighth Sustainable Development Goal, this quantitative study utilized a descriptive-experimental approach upon developing the foundations within the study, targeting the eight-point-three objective. Moreover, the product was tested on thirty simple random respondents, with half being the Civil Engineers, while the other being construction workers in Batangas City. The survey questionnaire was handed out through a platform for the Civil Engineers and physically through self-administered questionnaires and analyzed accordingly through the Mean Distribution Table and Two Sample Assuming Unequal Variance T-Test. The results have shown that the respondents are moderately concerned upon experiencing the existing device firsthand. Moreover, the respondents have also found interest, that the device is moderate upon optimizing its amplitude, portability, and adaptability for a more versatile exploration with the product. Upon this, the researchers have also taken note that the null hypothesis has failed to reject and that there is no significant difference in the level of concerns of the respondents with the levels upon optimization. The study’s results and conclusions have shown that although it was effective, the product has produced results that satisfied the variables alongside the respondents’ experience firsthand.

                            <h2>Product Features</h2>
                                <p><strong>Multifunctional Adapter:</strong> The universal adapter also transforms the concrete vibrator into various handheld tools, such as a screw or other construction tools. This versatility allows the device to serve multiple functions, making it ideal for different tasks on construction sites, ultimately enhancing its value and convenience for users.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Sling Strap:</strong> The inclusion of a sling strap makes it easier to carry the device, reducing strain on the user, which helps in mitigating the risk of long-term injuries such as Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS) caused by prolonged use.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Battery Indicator:</strong> The built-in battery indicator allows users to monitor the remaining battery life, ensuring they can plan their usage effectively. This feature helps users recharge the device before it runs out of power, preventing interruptions during operation and ensuring optimal productivity.

                            <h2>How it Aligns with SDG 8.3</h2>
                            <p><strong>Supporting Decent Work and Economic Growth:
                                </strong> The product is designed to promote decent work by improving safety and ergonomics in the construction industry. By reducing the risk of HAVS and offering a lightweight and portable design, it ensures that workers have safer tools, which leads to better overall productivity and health.
                            </p>
                                <p><strong>Growth of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs):
                                </strong> This product offers opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises to innovate and mass-produce tools that benefit construction sites. The focus on enhancing work conditions aligns with SDG 8.3’s goal of fostering growth through innovation and supporting growing enterprises.
