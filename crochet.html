                        <p>During the pandemic, I decided to try crocheting as a small business since I had become fond of making various items like bags and even clothes. It was a great experience because I learned how challenging it is to market handmade products, especially since crochet wasn’t as popular back then. Unfortunately, the business didn’t take off, and I soon realized how difficult it is to create something unique, especially with limited resources. Despite the setback, I gained valuable insights into the importance of understanding market trends and having a solid strategy. The financial side was especially tough—covering production costs, finding materials, and advertising with little initial capital proved to be more challenging than I expected. Through it all, I learned about the perseverance and creativity it takes to succeed as an entrepreneur, and how crucial it is to have the right support. This experience relates into the challenges of achieving <b>SDG 8</b> because I realized how tough it is for aspiring entrepreneurs to get started with limited resources. With little capital, I quickly saw how hard it is to compete in markets and build a business. This made me understand the importance of providing better support for small businesses, especially local ones. It's essential to create policies that help entrepreneurs thrive by giving them access to funding, guidance, and affordable resources. All in all, small businesses play a huge role in economic growth, job creation, and sustainable development, which are key goals of <b>SDG 8</b>.
